Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

- The Gaming Room client wants to develop a web-based game that served users on multiple platforms based on their current android app game, Draw It or Lose It.  The game, Draw It or Lose It, is a simple game where teams compete to guess what is being drawn based on a series of images that are displayed on the screen.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

- I believe I did a fairly good job at providing detailed explanations in a simple way that made the document easy to read and understand.  

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

- Having a design document to follow really helped with staying on task and ensuring that all technical requirements met the client expectations.  

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

- I would choose to make revisions to the recommendation section of the software design template.  I was vary vague in my response regarding security recommentdations. I provided a simple explanation pointing out that browsers across all platforms provide some sort of security when rendering an application, but did not provide any feedback on what security measures I would incorporate into the application itself to minimize vulnerabilities.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

- My interpretation of the user's needs were developing a game application that allows players to form teams.  Teams will then be able to start a game in which they will compete against other teams to guess drawings.  The game must be able to display an images from a stock of drawings at a constant rate.  Each game consists of 4 rounds. Rounds must last 1 minute each.  A team can guess unlimited number of times before puzzle are fully completed (30 seconds). 

Customer requirement were incorporating into game application using Object Oriented programming best practices. It is always importatn to consider user's needs as they are ultimately the entity for whom the application is created.  Providing a successful and positive experience guarentees user retention and success of the application.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

- I broke down client requirements into individual tasks to be completed or addressed, then moved forward with finding appropriate solutions. Modularity is emphasized repeatidly in computer science as a very effective way to write code and tackle one problem at a time. This approach helped me stay organized and ensure all tasked were handled accordingly.  Continuting to use this strategy moving forward, will only continue to help me succeed in computer science.
